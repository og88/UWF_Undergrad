Files and Functions in the program


twoSequences.c

/*This method reads two sequences from a file
 * The method then passes the sequences into the compare method*/
 
void twoSequences()

/*This method uses the c matrix to retrieve the LCS*/

void find(int** c, int x, int y, char * line1, char * line2)

/*This method calculates the c matrix for LCS. It does this by going through each character from the
 * second sequence and compares them to the characters of the first sequence
 * It then passes the sequences to the find method, to find the LCS*/
 
int compare(char * line, int read, char * line2, int read1, int true)


multipleSequences.c

/*This method reads an int and multiple strings from a file
 * The int is used to determine how many sentences there are.
 * The strings are compare and a table is filled up to show whether there are similar*/

void multipleSequences()

/*This method determines whether the the two compare sequences are High similarity,
 * Medium similarity,  Low similarity Depending on the length of the short, long, and LCS*/

char comp2(int sHort,int lOng, int compare)

/*This method computes assigns two methods with each other to be compared.
 * The method then records the length of the LCS and passes it to comp2*/
