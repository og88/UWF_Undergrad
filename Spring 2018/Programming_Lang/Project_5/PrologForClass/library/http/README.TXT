		SWI-Prolog HTTP support library

This  directory  provides  some  Prolog   libraries  for  accessing  and
providing HTTP services. The services are   intended to realise embedded
servers and form the basis for agent-protocols such as FIPA and SOAP.

These packages are documented in ../../packages/http.pdf.  The directory
../../packages/examples/http contains some demo code.

Documentation is also available from
