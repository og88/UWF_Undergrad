		     SWI-Prolog Semantic Web Library

Abstract
========

The semweb library provides a Prolog   library based on foreign-language
extensions for storing and manipulating RDF triples. It can handle quite
large sets of triples only  limited   by  available  memory. One million
triples requires about 80MB memory, so   a  fully equiped 32-bit machine
can handle about 40 million triples.


Prerequisites
=============

This library depends on the RDF parser  library which in turn depends on
the XML parser provided by the sgml package.


Further info
============

This library defines the semantic web infrastructure for SWI-Prolog. The
library is documented in semweb.pdf or   the  equivalent semweb.html. If
your  installation  does   not   include    this   file,   please  visit
http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/


Staying up-to-date
==================

This library is under active  development.   The  recent  version can be
accessed from the CVS repository under the directory pl/packages/semweb.
See http://www.swi-prolog.org/cvs.html for details on the CVS server and
instructions for browsing the repository online.
