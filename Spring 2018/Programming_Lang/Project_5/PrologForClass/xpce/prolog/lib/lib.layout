Hi David,

Dave Rahn said you would be my contact at Quintus for ProWindows
related technical issues.  Could you comment on the issue below.
It concerns naming of the libraries.  As I'm very reluctent to
change the naming schema for compatibility reasons I'd like to
do this properly once and forever.

I'm in the process of reorganising the Prolog library files for
ProWindows-3.  The main reason for doing so is to get them unique
in 8 characters, so the same library structure may be used to the
MS-Windows and Unix versions.

To identify PW3 (= (X)PCE) libraries from ordinary Prolog libraries,
they are at the moment tagged with pce_: pce_debug.pl, pce_edit.pl,
etc.

This is not very elegant, but more seriously it leads to various name
conflicts when loading on the restricted DOS filesystem.

Therefore I plan to move things into the following structure:

	..../lib/pce.pl		Main PW3 library file
	..../lib/pce/*.pl	Various utility libraries
	..../lib/pce/man.pl	Load manual tools
	..../lib/pce/man/*.pl	Actual implementation of the manual tools
	...

This would imply that `library(pce)' loads the main library;
library('pce/edit') loads the edit utilities, library('pce/man')
loads the manual tools and library('pce/man/p_card') loads the
manuals' card tools.

Now unfortunately this doesn't work in Quintus as `library(pce)' will
try to consult the *directory* `pce' instead of the file `pce.pl'.

Now my question is whether this is considered a dubious feature by
Quintus, whether it is possible to hack around this and finally whether
you have a better proposal to organise this big library (using short
filenames :-().

	Hope to hear from you soon
