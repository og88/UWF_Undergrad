			PceEmacs/Prolog IDE TODO list

* Check M-x comment_column

* Distinguish interactive and system commands

* Fix bookmark handling
	- save/restore
	- only show current directory and provide `up' button as navigator

* Prolog mode and Colouring
	- Provide menu on calls for definition/documentation
	- Colour redefined global/system predicates
	- Base goto-definition on colour-xref database

* Prolog navigator
	- Silent handling of parsing errors (as colouring does).
	- Graphical indication on the presence of errors (also for prolog mode)
