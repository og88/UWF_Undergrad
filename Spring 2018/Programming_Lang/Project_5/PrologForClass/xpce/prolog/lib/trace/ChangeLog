		      SWI-Prolog GUI tracer ChangeLog


This ChangeLog logs changes to the debugger   as  well as changes to the
rest of the system that only affect the debugger.


VERSION 1.1.1 for SWI-Prolog 5.0.2
==================================

* FIXED: Handling of I_CATCH and I_CONTEXT instructions for unifying and
  locating calls in clauses.

* FIXED: Avoid sending ->file: @nil to the source-view

* FIXED: `Up' pass through foreign frames, so we can really get to the top,
  regardless of intermediate foreign frames caused by breaks, XPCE message
  passing, etc.
